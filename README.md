# ai-quiz-questions

This repo hosts a [discussion](https://github.com/greg-gorlen-andela/ai-quiz-questions/discussions) which allows for community review of AI generated quiz content.

## Thread template

```markdown
This thread contains quiz questions generated by an LLM.

The goal is to get human validation so we can determine which questions could be useful in actual quizzes and which prompt techniques result in better questions on average.

## Instructions

Please thumbs up any questions you like, and thumbs down any questions you don't. If you don't understand the question, or you feel the question is not particularly strong or weak, don't vote on it.

**Ignore the up arrow that's auto-generated on each question** because it has no downvote counterpart:

Feel free to add a comment explaining why you voted as you did.
